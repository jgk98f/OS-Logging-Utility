This project facilitates a program that test the logging utility named loglib.cpp.
This logging utility allows the user to add messages, save log with designated
name, clear log, and get the log string. This utilizes two static structures to
act like a log and it is implemented in a linked list. The program that displays
the logging facility is named main.cpp and it calls all of the logging functions
exactly twice, no matter what flags the user enters. 

Usage:
      Usage format: main [-h, -help, -n integer, or -l fileName]
      
The flags -h and -help trigger a usage function to display how the program is to
be used. The flag -n sets an integer value to the argument provided after the flag.
The -l flag specifies the name of the log file to save to. Otherwise, the program 
uses the file named 'logfile.txt' to save the log messages to.

Compiling:
          make -f MakeFile
          
The project includes a make file for compiling the project with the required flags 
and names the executable 'main'. To run this executable refer to the usage section.

Cleaning:
         make -f MakeFile clean
        
The above command is the cleaning routine for removing the object files and the other
dev environment such as *.layout and *.dev files.
